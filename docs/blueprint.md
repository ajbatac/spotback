## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft, muted green (#A7D1AB) to evoke a sense of calm and nature, aligning with Spotify's brand while keeping it gentle for the neomorphic style.
- Background color: Light gray (#E0E0E0) with a subtle, almost imperceptible green tint to complement the primary color and maintain a soft, clean look. Creates a backdrop that enhances the neomorphic elements.
- Accent color: Slightly darker, desaturated green (#8FBCA2) used for interactive elements and subtle highlights. This provides a gentle contrast without disrupting the overall soft color scheme.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) offers a blend of modern and approachable, suitable for a functional application with a neomorphic feel. Good for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, line-based icons with rounded corners, in the accent color (#8FBCA2). Follow the same design language and theme.
- Implement a clean, minimalist layout with plenty of whitespace. Employ subtle shadows and highlights to achieve the neomorphic effect, making elements appear as if they are extruding from the background.
- Incorporate gentle, unobtrusive animations for transitions and interactions, such as fading effects and smooth movement. These animations should enhance the user experience without being distracting.
